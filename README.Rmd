Umbrella facilitates access and extraction of CHIRPS rainfall data and fitting of seasonal profiles. 

The package leans heavily on data and functionality from:

CHIRPS:
Please see the [CHIRPS website](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) for more information, usage rights and 
[citation infromation](http://legacy.chg.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/#_Citations).

## Installation

Please install from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/umbrella")
```

We estimate the fourier series representing general seasonal profiles given rainfall in a setting
using the following equation

where `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, `g3`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3` are fitted parameters. This equation
can be fitted as a linear model using Rs `lm` function.

However, we impose an additional constraint when fitting: the rainfall floor. This sets a minimum
lower bound on the value of rainfall. With this constraint we fit the resulting model with the 
`optim()` function.
