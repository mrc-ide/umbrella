Umbrella facilitates access and extraction of CHIRPS rainfall data and
fitting of seasonal profiles.

The package leans heavily on data and functionality from:

CHIRPS: Please see the [CHIRPS
website](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) for more information,
usage rights and [citation
infromation](http://legacy.chg.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/#_Citations).

Google Earth Engine: Please see (and sign up for) [Google Earth
Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)

rgee: A superb R package for acessing and processing data from Google
Earth Engine. Please see [rgee](https://r-spatial.github.io/rgee/) for
more info.

## Installation

Please install from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/umbrella")
```

You will also need to sign up to [Google Earth
Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and follow the [set up
instructions for rgee](https://r-spatial.github.io/rgee/#installation)
before using `umbrella`.

We estimate the fourier series representing general seasonal profiles
given rainfall in a setting using the following equation

where

![ g\_{0}, g\_{1}, g\_{2}, g\_{3}, h\_{1}, h\_{2}, h\_{3} ](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D&space;%5Cbg_white&space;%20g_%7B0%7D%2C%20g_%7B1%7D%2C%20g_%7B2%7D%2C%20g_%7B3%7D%2C%20h_%7B1%7D%2C%20h_%7B2%7D%2C%20h_%7B3%7D%20 " g_{0}, g_{1}, g_{2}, g_{3}, h_{1}, h_{2}, h_{3} ")

are fitted parameters. This equation can be fitted as a linear model
using Rs `lm` function.

However, we impose an additional constraint when fitting: the rainfall
floor. This sets a minimum lower bound on the value of rainfall. With
this constraint we fit the resulting model with the `nlm()` function.
